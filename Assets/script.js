// pesudo code

// Base html page 

// a START button
//      gonna need a button
//      event listener, listens for click
//      Math.random question selector from an object/array with questions: and answers, will probably need an .each loop method to cycle through the object/array
// TIMER starts
//      gonna need a timer that countsdown from a set time (2:00 minutes? or 120 seconds)
// A WILD QUESTION APPEARS
//      some div field gets txt content updated
//      some kind of input field - bootstrap
//          if/else comparator validation to correct answer
// correct answers, continues to next question
//      something is keeping score, counter thing, maybe keep the counter near the timer
// wrong answers, time is subtracted from the clock and continues to next question
// game ends when either timer runs out, or all the questions have been answered
// GAME OVER - score, and save initials in a high score page
//      local storage for names and scores
// HIGH SCORES - possibly a new page, otherwise it's a function that replaces the html on the page with a local storage list of high scores and user input names and scores
